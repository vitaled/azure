    "abstract": "Anna Karenina consists of more than the story of Anna Karenina, a married socialite, and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky, though their relationship is a very strong component of the plot.[4] The story starts when she arrives in the midst of a family broken up by her brother's unbridled womanizingâ€”something that prefigures her own later situation, though she would experience less tolerance by others.",
